      "LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him.\n",

      "To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground.\n",

      "Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill.\n",
      "\n",
      "An inmate housed on the \"forgotten floor,\" where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the \"forgotten floor.\" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually \"avoidable felonies.\" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail.\n",
      "\n",
      "We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' »\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!\" one man shouts at me.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered \"lunatics\" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the \"forgotten floor\"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again.\n",

      "\n",
      "The family eventually told CNN their story -- that Youssif was grabbed by masked men outside their home on January 15, doused in gasoline and set on fire.

Watch CNN's Arwa Damon describe 'truly phenomenal' outpouring »\n",

      "Shortly after Youssif's story aired Wednesday, the Children's Burn Foundation -- a nonprofit organization based in Sherman Oaks, California, that provides support for burn victims locally, nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for Youssif and his family to come to the United States and to set up a fund for donations.\n",

      "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As he awaits a crucial progress report on Iraq, President Bush will try to put a twist on comparisons of the war to Vietnam by invoking the historical lessons of that conflict to argue against pulling out.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Bush pauses Tuesday during a news conference at the  North American Leaders summit in Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Wednesday in Kansas City, Missouri, Bush will tell members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that \"then, as now, people argued that the real problem was America's presence and that if we would just withdraw, the killing would end,\" according to speech excerpts released Tuesday by the White House.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left,\" Bush will say.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whatever your position in that debate, one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens, whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like 'boat people,' 're-education camps' and 'killing fields,' \" the president will say.\n",
      "\n",
      "The president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today's terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility, citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam, according to the excerpts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here at home, some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently,\" Bush will say.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tuesday, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, \"President Bush's attempt to compare the war in Iraq to past military conflicts in East Asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two. Our nation was misled by the Bush Administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of Iraq under false pretenses, leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"While the President continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in Iraq, paid for by the taxpayers, American lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the Iraqi government. It is time to change direction in Iraq, and Congress will again work to do so in the fall.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The White House is billing the speech, along with another address next week to the American Legion, as an effort to \"provide broader context\" for the debate over the upcoming Iraq progress report by Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the American people -- to withhold judgment on his troop \"surge\" in Iraq until the report comes out in September.  Watch Bush criticize the Iraqi government »\n",
      "\n",
      "It is being closely watched on Capitol Hill, particularly by Republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq might begin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bush's speeches Wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the White House to try to reframe the debate over Iraq, as public support for the war continues to sag.\n",
      "\n",
      "A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of Americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the Iraq war, and 72 percent say that even if Petraeus reports progress, it won't change their opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report; 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to his analogy to Vietnam, Bush in Wednesday's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from Asia, including the U.S. defeat and occupation of Japan after World War II and the Korean War in the 1950s, according to the excerpts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the aftermath of Japan's surrender, many thought it naive to help the Japanese transform themselves into a democracy. Then, as now, the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom,\" Bush will say. \"Today, in defiance of the critics, Japan ... stands as one of the world's great free societies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking about the Korean War, Bush will note that at the time \"critics argued that the war was futile, that we never should have sent our troops in, or that America's intervention was divisive here at home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"While it is true that the Korean War had its share of challenges, America never broke its word,\" Bush will say. \"Without America's intervention during the war, and our willingness to stick with the South Koreans after the war, millions of South Koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime.\" E-mail to a friend###Assistant: -------------\n",

      "(CNN) -- A virus found in healthy Australian honey bees may be playing a role in the collapse of honey bee colonies across the United States, researchers reported Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honey bees walk on a moveable comb hive at the Bee Research Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees -- up to 90 percent of colonies in some U.S. beekeeping operations -- imperiling the crops largely dependent upon bees for pollination, such as oranges, blueberries, apples and almonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture says honey bees are responsible for pollinating $15 billion worth of crops each year in the United States. More than 90 fruits and vegetables worldwide depend on them for pollination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Signs of colony collapse disorder were first reported in the United States in 2004, the same year American beekeepers started importing bees from Australia.\n",
      "\n",
      "The disorder is marked by hives left with a queen, a few newly hatched adults and plenty of food, but the worker bees responsible for pollination gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The virus identified in the healthy Australian bees is  Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) -- named that because it was discovered by Hebrew University researchers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although worker bees in colony collapse disorder vanish, bees infected with IAPV die close to the hive, after developing shivering wings and paralysis. For some reason, the Australian bees seem to be resistant to IAPV and do not come down with symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists used genetic analyses of bees collected over the past three years and found that IAPV was present in bees that had come from colony collapse disorder hives 96 percent of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the study released Thursday on the Science Express Web site, operated by the journal Science, cautioned that collapse disorder is likely caused by several factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This research give us a very good lead to follow, but we do not believe IAPV is acting alone,\" said Jeffery S. Pettis of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Bee Research Laboratory and a co-author of the study. \"Other stressors on the colony are likely involved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This could explain why bees in Australia may be resistant to colony collapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are no cases ... in Australia at all,\" entomologist Dave Britton of the Australian Museum told the Sydney Morning Herald last month. \"It is a Northern Hemisphere phenomenon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bee ecology expert and University of Florida professor Jamie Ellis said earlier this year that genetic weakness bred into bees over time, pathogens spread by parasites and the effects of pesticides and pollutants might be other factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers also say varroa mites affect all hives on the U.S. mainland but are not found in Australia.\n",
      "\n",
      "University of Georgia bee researcher Keith S. Delaplane said Thursday the study offers a warning -- and hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One nagging problem has been a general inability to treat or vaccinate bees against viruses of any kind,\" said Delaplane, who has been trying to breed bees resistant to the varroa mite.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But in the case of IAPV, there is evidence that some bees carry genetic resistance to the disorder. This is yet one more argument for beekeepers to use honey bee stocks that are genetically disease- and pest-resistant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bee researchers will now look for stresses that may combine to kill bees.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The next step is to ascertain whether IAPV, alone or in concert with other factors, can induce CCD [colony collapse disorder] in healthy bees,\" said Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.\n",

      "\n",
      "Acting on a tip, police met over the weekend at McCarran International Airport with 46-year-old Walter Alexander, of Mesa, Arizona, who told them about the alleged robbery and validated the tipster's information, Capt. James Dillon told reporters.\n",

      "Alexander was arrested Saturday night on two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary with a deadly weapon.\n",

      "Nichols dismissed an initial report that the men may have been off-duty police.\n",
      "\n",

      "(CNN) -- A former government contract employee was indicted on charges of stealing restricted nuclear energy-related materials and putting the United States at risk, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sources say the classified materials were taken from the East Tennessee Technology Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy Lynn Oakley, 67, of Roane County, Tennessee, appeared in federal court in Knoxville on Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oakley was briefly detained for questioning in the case in January, when authorities first learned of the alleged plot to divulge the materials, government sources told CNN. He voluntarily surrendered Thursday at an FBI field office in Knoxville, the sources said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oakley is a former employee of Bechtel Jacobs, the Department of Energy's prime environmental management contractor at the East Tennessee Technology Park, prosecutors said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The indictment states that Oakley, \"having possession of, access to and having been entrusted with sections of 'barriers' and associated hardware used for uranium enrichment through the process of gaseous diffusion ... having reason to believe that such data would be utilized to injure the United States and secure an advantage to a foreign nation, did communicate, transmit and disclose such data to another person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The transfer took place January 26, the indictment alleges. Oakley is also charged with converting the material and \"restricted data\" to his own use. He began doing so on about October 17, 2006, and continued through January, prosecutors said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oakley's attorney, Herb Moncier, said outside court Thursday that Oakley's job was to break rods \"into little pieces\" and throw them away. Moncier said Oakley had a security clearance, but Moncier did not believe it was a high-level clearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government alleges that in January, Oakley attempted to sell the \"pieces of scrap\" to someone he thought was a French agent -- but in reality was an undercover FBI agent, Moncier said. He said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an \"appliance\" under the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Oakley has cooperated fully for the last six months,\" said Moncier, who added that he had traveled to Washington for work on the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"While none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization, the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the safeguards and put that technology in the wrong hands,\" Kenneth Wainstein, assistant attorney general for national security, said in the Justice Department statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "One government source said the materials involved are not the \"crown jewels,\" but they should not have been taken from the facility.\n",
      "\n",
      "A \"barrier\" is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process, according to nuclear energy officials, but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sources told CNN that federal authorities have been following Oakley and investigating the case for at least six months, after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oakley, described as a low-level employee, apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind, an official familiar with the case said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of Oakley's alleged intentions six months ago, the FBI and Department of Energy launched a joint investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FBI then developed a sting operation, government officials familiar with the case said, and authorities intervened before there could be any involvement of a foreign country.\n",
      "\n",
      "East Tennessee Technology Park is an area of the DOE's Oak Ridge reservation \"where we are currently decontaminating and decommissioning buildings that were last used in 1985,\" Gerald Boyd, manager of the DOE's Oak Ridge site office, said Thursday. \"When they were in use, now over 20 years ago, some of the buildings at ETTP housed facilities used for the enrichment of uranium.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Boyd said the technology park and the reservation \"are protected by multiple layers of security systems and detection programs, both visible and unseen, meant to identify rogue employees attempting to abuse their access and position.\"\n",

      "HONG KONG, China (Reuters) -- Paul Lee got his liver from an executed Chinese prisoner; Karam in Egypt bought a kidney for his sister for $5,300; in Istanbul Hakan is holding out for $30,700 for one of his kidneys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctors in Pakistan have been arrested for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are not so unusual: a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners with end-stage illnesses to poorer places like China, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Colombia and the Philippines to buy a new lease of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lee, a 53-year-old chief subway technician in Hong Kong, was diagnosed with liver cancer in January 2005 but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread.\n",
      "\n",
      "A friend told him about a transplant hospital in China's north eastern Tianjin city and he signed up for a place. That April, he paid 260,000 yuan ($34,380) for a transplant -- surgery that saved his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The hospital has connections with a lot of prisons,\" Lee told Reuters. \"Mine came from an executed prisoner from Heilongjiang. I thank the donor deeply.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Health Organization estimates that 21,000 liver transplants are carried out annually, but medical experts put annual worldwide demand at at least 90,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Demand for kidneys also exceeds supply, and that has given rise to organ trafficking and a black market for rich people and \"transplant tourists\" who travel to poor countries to buy body parts from people with few other routes to a better living.\n",
      "\n",
      "A donor in South Africa receives $700 for a kidney compared with $30,000 in the United States. A lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on, or at least regulate, the trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even where the trade is banned, laws are often muddled or laced with loopholes, which are sometimes defended by vested interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the unregulated route is much less complicated for the recipient. Any transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor -- especially for liver transplants which involve removing part of the donor's liver.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complications can include bleeding, infection, even death.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the transplant trade, the recipient need not worry about, for example, exposing a living relative to that risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is cheaper and your next of kin is not taking the risk and you don't have to care for someone you don't know. Once you pay, it is discarded in a way, it is dispensable,\" said Luc Noel, a Geneva-based coordinator for Clinical Procedures at the World Health Organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "China recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners, saying it must first meet demand at home for 2 million organs a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only 20,000 transplants are carried out in China each year. Of these, 3,000 are liver transplants and 95 percent of them use livers from dead donors.\n",
      "\n",
      "China defended its use of organs from executed prisoners, saying consent was obtained from convicts or their families. A transplant operation using the liver of a dead donor costs around $33,000 in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is important is the transparency, it has to be open to scrutiny ... if China makes its current system open to scrutiny and very transparent, that would do good,\" said the WHO's Noel.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Asia, a cultural obsession with keeping the body of the deceased intact has stymied public organ donation programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excluding China, Asia has fewer than 200 livers donated by people ahead of their death each year, said Lo Chung-man, professor of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery at the University of Hong Kong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pakistan, where trade in human organs is not illegal, is turning into a \"kidney bazaar\", said the chief executive of Pakistan's Kidney Foundation, Jaffar Naqvi.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are no confirmed figures for the number of foreigners coming to the country for new kidneys but Naqvi said there were 13 centers in Lahore alone which reported more than 2,000 transplants last year from bought kidneys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients, mostly from Europe, Saudi Arabia and India, pay about 500,000 rupees ($8,500) for a new kidney, he said. Donors are paid $300 to $1,000 and often get no medical care after the surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no consent in some cases. In May police arrested nine people, four of them doctors, for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys for transplant operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the pipeline is a draft law aimed at banning the trade, but a powerful lobby bent on preserving it is trying to ensure it allows kidney donations for a non-relative, with no payment. Such a clause allowing \"altruistic\" organ donations will ensure the trade continues with secret payment to donors, Naqvi said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stories of people selling their organs, especially kidneys, are not uncommon in Egypt, where more than 30 percent of a population of more than 73 million people live below the poverty line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Karam, who asked to be identified only by his first name because organ trading is illegal, said it took him only 15 days to secure a kidney for his sister who was suffering from kidney failure. He said a doctor found him a man willing to sell his kidney for 30,000 Egyptian pounds ($5,300).\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The fees of the doctor were 5,000 pounds. Both his money and the fees of the hospital were deducted from the money the 'donor' received,\" said Karam.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said doctors usually help in finding people willing to sell their organs from their patients' lists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abdel-Kader Hegazy, head of the disciplinary committee at the Doctors' Union, said Egyptian law lacks clear punishment for those involved in illegal transplants, making it easy for doctors to repeat the offence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The law says it is illegal to trade in organs but does not specify the punishment. We at the union suspended many doctors and closed their practices, but they have appealed before courts and won their licenses back,\" he told Reuters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is an annoying and a regrettable situation. Well-known doctors and professors are doing this. They are rich people but they do it because they have no moral values.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The union has been pushing for legislation to regulate organ transplants, with a draft bill including heavy fines and a prison sentence for those involved and a ban on transplants between people of different nationalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the draft law has been languishing in parliament for several years because of differences between doctors and senior Muslim religious leaders on whether Islam allows organ transplants in the case of clinical deaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Turkey, students, unemployed young men and struggling fathers post adverts on the Internet selling their kidneys, listing their drinking and smoking habits and blood type.\n",
      "\n",

      "LOS ANGELES, California (Reuters)  -- \"To insure or not to insure?\" It isn't Shakespeare, but it is the dramatic question Hollywood filmmakers are asking about Lindsay Lohan following her legal troubles this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lindsay Lohan may still get work after her legal problems are settled, but the cost will be high.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is an important question, too, because whether companies insure Lohan's future movies may determine whether she will quickly fall off Hollywood's A-list.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Lohan fans have little to fear because no actor is uninsurable, say underwriting experts. While some producers may balk at conditions for hiring problematic stars, experts say that unless an actor is serving time in prison, even the most volatile can be covered -- albeit at a high cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For a price, anything can be done, although an insurance carrier can make things so unpalatable that at times the makers of the film just won't be interested,\" said Ross Miller, partner with insurance brokerage D.R. Reiff & Associates Inc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lohan's arrest this week in Los Angeles on suspicion of drunken driving and cocaine possession has left Hollywood wondering if the actress, who shot to fame as a child in Disney films like \"The Parent Trap,\" is too risky to cast in a film.  Timeline: Lindsay Lohan's troubles »\n",
      "\n",
      "It remains to be seen whether her latest relapse and brush with the law will cost her a role in \"Poor Things,\" a film produced by and starring Oscar-winner Shirley MacLaine.  See a gallery of Lohan's films »\n",
      "\n",
      "A statement was expected early next week on whether the movie, already delayed this spring due to an earlier rehab stint by Lohan, will proceed with or without her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Insurance experts say the industry has long dealt with similar situations, although they may seem more frequent with the recent heavy media scrutiny of Lohan and fellow troubled party girls Paris Hilton and Britney Spears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think it (a problematic artist) is any more of an issue,\" said Wendy Diaz, entertainment underwriting director at Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., the leading film underwriter. \"It's pretty standard year to year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Diaz did say the terms for covering Lohan would likely be \"serious at this point.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She said Fireman's Fund, in such a case, would likely put in higher deductibles, or ask the star to put their salary into escrow to pay for any losses if production was disrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last July, a producer on Lohan's last film, \"Georgia Rule,\" scolded her publicly for repeatedly showing up late on the set, costing the movie's makers hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brian Kingman, a managing director with entertainment insurance broker Aon/Albert G. Ruben said covering situations like Lohan's required a lot of calculation and risk management.\n",
      "\n",
      "Insurance rates for errant actors can range anywhere from 1 percent to 3 percent of a movie's production budget, which can range from $5 million to $100 million or more, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Filmmakers fall in love with certain actors for certain roles and my job is to find risk-takers to take on the risk,\" Kingman said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said actors were always required to undergo a medical exam before getting insurance. In certain circumstances, drug screening is conducted and actors are required to provide blood and urine samples. In cases of known drug abuse, \"minders\" are sometimes required on set to keep an eye on the actor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kingman said he had even helped craft policies for actors in the event they risked the possibility of incarceration.\n",

      "\n",
      "Spidey then gave the boy from a far-away land a gentle hug, embracing him in his iconic blue and red tights. He showed Youssif a few tricks, like how to shoot a web from his wrist. Only this time, no web was spun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right Youssif!\" Spider-Man said after the boy mimicked his wrist movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other superheroes crowded around to get a closer look. Even the Green Goblin stopped his villainous ways to tell the boy hi. Youssif remained unfazed. He didn't take a liking to Spider-Man's nemesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spidey was just too cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was my favorite thing,\" the boy said later. \"I want to see him again.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "This was the day of dreams when the boy's nightmares were, at least temporarily, forgotten. He met SpongeBob, Lassie and a 3-year-old orangutan named Archie. The hairy, brownish-red primate took to the boy, grabbing his hand and holding it. Even when Youssif pulled away, Archie would inch his hand back toward the boy's and then snatch it.  See Youssif enjoy being a boy again »\n",
      "\n",
      "The boy giggled inside a play area where sponge-like balls shot out of toy guns. It was a far different artillery than what he was used to seeing in central Baghdad, as recently as a week ago. He squealed with delight and raced around the room collecting as many balls as he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "He rode a tram through the back stages at Universal Studios. At one point, the car shook. Fire and smoke filled the air, debris cascaded down and a big rig skidded toward the vehicle. The boy and his family survived the pretend earthquake unscathed.\n",

      "\n",
      "The father sought help for his boy across Baghdad, but no one listened. He remembers his son's two months of hospitalization. The doctors didn't use anesthetics. He could hear his boy's piercing screams from the other side of the hospital.  Watch Youssif meet his doctor and play with his little sister »\n",

      "\"Anything for Youssif,\" he said. \"We had to do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They described a life of utter chaos in Baghdad. Neighbors had recently given birth to a baby girl. Shortly afterward, the father was kidnapped and killed. Then, there was the time when some girls wore tanktops and jeans. They were snatched off the street by gunmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stories can be even more gruesome. The couple said they had heard reports that a young girl was kidnapped and beheaded --and her killers sewed a dog's head on the corpse and delivered it to her family's doorstep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These are just some of the stories,\" said Youssif's mother, Zainab.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under Saddam Hussein, there was more security and stability, they said. There was running water and electricity most of the time. But still life was tough under the dictator, like the time when Zainab's uncle disappeared and was never heard from again after he read a \"religious book,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sitting in the parking lot of a Target in suburban Los Angeles, Youssif's father watched as husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, parents and their children, came and went. Some held hands. Others smiled and laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Iraq finished,\" he said in what few English words he knows.\n",

      "\n",
      "His two children have only seen war. But this week, the family has seen a much different side of America -- an outpouring of generosity and a peaceful nation at home. \"It's been a dream,\" the father said.\n",

      "He used to do a lot of volunteer work back in Baghdad. \"Maybe that's why I'm being helped now,\" the father said.\n",

      "\n",
      "Those familiar with the field have no doubt that the Princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo in a gesture which was not choreographed but sprung from a deep identification with those who were vulnerable and on the margin.\n",
      "\n",

      "The role brought great power but, like any member of the Royal Family, she also experienced the weight of expectation and the intensity of the scrutiny.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honoring but managing the role and not allowing it to take over one's personal humanity is a desperately difficult task. As we have heard from Prince Harry, his mother Diana did all that she could to prepare her sons for the work which lies ahead.\n",

      "She confessed to receiving a very great deal from some of those whose lives she touched.

      "LONDON, England (CNN) -- French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner's declaration that France had to prepare for the possibility of war against Iran over its nuclear program was not conventional diplomatic behavior. But then Kouchner was never expected to be a soft-soaper on the diplomatic scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner has a reputation for challenging convention and authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "A surprise appointment from the Socialist ranks to Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative government, the founder of Medicins Sans Frontiers has always challenged convention and authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "The former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali once called Kouchner 'an unguided missile' and the man himself has been known to declare: \"To change the law you sometimes have to break the law\". He was in his youth one of the leaders of the students revolt in France in May 1968.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kouchner is a humanitarian as well as a patriot, with a strong commitment to human rights. Unusually for a man of the Left, he supported the US-led intervention in Iraq (while criticizing the aftermath). But he did so on the grounds of Saddam Hussein's denial of human rights, not his possible possession of weapons of mass destruction. His and President Sarkozy's concern for human rights lies behind their eagerness to join Gordon Brown's Britain in a new push for action in Darfur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bernard Kouchner did not come to his position with any of former President Chirac's instinctive distrust of the United States. Washington, which has been critical of some European states for their weakness in confronting Teheran, will have been delighted by his 'get serious' warning to Teheran. But the plain-speaking Kouchner is unlikely to be deterred by fears of upsetting the White House when he has criticisms to make of US policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "How much should be made of his words on Iran remains unclear at this stage. They were scarcely on the same scale as President Chirac's threat when he was still in office to retaliate with nuclear strikes against any state found to be responsible for a large-scale terrorist attack on France. But they are all of a piece with France's new high-profile style under the presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Kouchner, for example, became the first French Foreign Minister to visit Iraq since 1988, insisting that there could only be a political solution to the country's problems, not a military one, and offering France's services as a mediator and 'honest broker' between Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Iran he is, in a way, merely echoing the words of his President who declared in a speech last month that a nuclear-armed Iran would be 'unacceptable' and describing the stand-off over its nuclear program as 'undoubtedly the most serious crisis before us today'. Certainly Mr Kouchner is making clear that France no longer takes the view once expressed by President Chirac that a nuclear-armed Iran might be inevitable\n",
      "\n",
      "In continuing to ratchet up the rhetoric over that threat and to underline the West's resolution on Iran's nuclear enrichment program Mr Kouchner is supplementing his president's warnings. Neither is saying that military intervention against Iran is imminent or inevitable. Neither has yet confirmed that France would be part of any such military action. But both are stressing the risks which are piling up as a result of Teheran's brinkmanship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the strongest lesson though from Mr Kouchner's intervention is his underlining that the new administration in France is not a knee-jerk anti-American one -- and that France is in the business of reclaiming a role at the top diplomatic tables.

      "Written by: Ludwig van Beethoven\n",
      "\n",
      "Written for: Some girl probably not named Elise. In fact, as far as most historians can tell, Beethoven didn't even know an Elise. Instead, the song was originally titled \"Bagatelle in A minor\" based on some handwritten notation a Beethoven researcher claimed to have seen on a now-lost copy of the sheet music.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further complicating things, Beethoven had hideous handwriting -- to the point that some scholars speculate the song was actually written \"for Therese,\" as in Therese Malfatti, one of several women who turned down a marriage proposal from the notoriously lovesick maestro.\n",

      "2. \"Philadelphia Freedom\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Written by: Elton John & Bernie Taupin\n",
      "\n",
      "Written for: Billie Jean King, as a thank-you for a tracksuit she gave Elton. And what a tracksuit it must have been! The 1975 song remains one of the most popular disco hits ever, leaving thousands of Hustle enthusiasts wondering just what Billie Jean King had to do with Philadelphia, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turns out, the song was a reference to King's pro tennis team, The Philadelphia Freedoms. Prior to 1968, tennis players were all considered \"amateurs\" and weren't eligible to receive prize money. So, if you didn't have the wealth to support yourself, you couldn't play. Billie Jean King fought against those constraints, ultimately founding Professional World Team Tennis in 1974 and turning tennis into a paid league sport.\n",

      "Written by: The Kinks' Ray Davies\n",
      "\n",
      "Written for: A transvestite. But the question is, which one? According to Rolling Stone, \"Lola\" was inspired by Candy Darling, a member of Andy Warhol's entourage, whom Ray Davies briefly (and cluelessly) dated. If that's the case, then \"Lola\" is just another notch on Darling's song belt -- she's also referred to in Lou Reed's \"Walk on the Wild Side.\" (\"Candy came from out on the Island/ In the backroom she was everybody's darlin'.\")\n",
      "\n",
      "But, in the Kinks' official biography, Davies tells a different story. He says \"Lola\" was written after the band's manager spent a very drunken night dancing with a woman whose five o'clock shadow was apparently obvious to everyone but him.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. \"867-5309/Jenny\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Written by: Jim Keller (of Tommy Tutone) and Alex Call\n",
      "\n",
      "Written for: Unknown, as the songwriters apparently make up a different story about its inspiration every time they're asked. While the woman continues to remain a mystery, however, the phone number is all too real. In fact, it's been wreaking havoc ever since 1982 and the passage of time hasn't quelled of the number of crank calls. In 1999, Brown University freshman roommates Nina Clemente and Jahanaz Mirza found that out the hard way, when the school adopted an 867 exchange number for its on-campus phone system. Immediately, the girls' innocuous Room No. 5309 became a magnet for every drunk college kid with a 1980s fetish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other unfortunate phone customers have fought back with creative and profitable solutions, like the holder of 212-867-5309, who put his phone number up for auction on eBay in 2004. Bids approached $100,000 before eBay pulled the item at the request of Verizon, the number's actual owner.\n",

      "\n",
      "Written by: Neil Sedaka\n",

      "\n",
      "However, the real success of \"Oh, Carol\" came a few months later, when it inspired King to write a rebuttal entitled \"Oh, Neil.\" At the time, King and her husband, Gerry Goffin, were fledgling songwriters in need of a hit tune. \"Oh, Neil\" wasn't that, but it did pay off. After Sedaka gave a tape of the song to his boss, King and Goffin landed jobs at the legendary Brill Building pop music factory, where the duo went on to write chart-toppers like \"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\" and \"The Loco-Motion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "6. \"It Ain't Me, Babe\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Written by: Bob Dylan\n",
      "\n",
      "Written for: Joan Baez, though it clearly wasn't the nicest gift Dylan could have given her. The two met in 1961, when Baez was an up-and-coming folk singer and Dylan was a nobody from Minnesota. Desperate to make his break in the music biz, Dylan worked like crazy to get Baez's attention. He eventually ended up going on tour with her, which is how he first became famous, and also how the two began dating. For a while, they seemed like the golden couple, but things soon went downhill.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a European concert tour together in early 1965, they had a huge fight and parted ways. That May, Dylan was holed up in a hotel after being hospitalized with a virus, and Baez, hoping to remain friends, decided to bring him flowers. Sadly, that's how she found out that her ex was already dating someone else. That someone else was Sara Lownds, whom Dylan married a mere six months later.\n",

      "\n",
      "Written by: Graham Nash (of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young)\n",
      "\n",
      "Written for: Joni Mitchell. In December 1968, Nash and Mitchell moved into a cozy little house in the Laurel Canyon section of Los Angeles. Though commonly left out of the hippy pantheon, Laurel Canyon was sort of a commune-home away from commune-home for San Francisco society -- not just CSN&Y, but also Jim Morrison, the Eagles, Frank Zappa, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our House\" was directly inspired by a lazy Sunday in the Nash/Mitchell household. The couple went out to brunch, hit an antiques store, and then returned to find the house just a bit chilly, at which point Nash literally \"lit a fire,\" while Mitchell \"placed the flowers in the vase that she bought that day.\" No, really. The whole tableau seemed so ridiculously domestic to Nash that he immediately sat down and spent the rest of the day writing about it. E-mail to a friend###Assistant: -------------\n",

      "The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $3 billion, according to TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group, CNN's consultant on political television advertising.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $1.7 billion. In 2006, $2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy TV commercials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money, said Evan Tracey, CMAG's chief operating officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates, who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters.  See how spending breaks down for this year »\n",
      "\n",
      "And interest groups have spent $6.2 million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the national level, the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $270 million in the first nine months of this year. Subjects ranged from the Iraq war to telecommunications reform. Television ads on health care alone total $60 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "CMAG estimates more than $3 million of the $270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups \"pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries, and through the general election, is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, CMAG predicts that more than $800 million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up to now, the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on February 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads all candidates in TV spending, having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $8.6 million. This is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle.  Watch how Romney is way ahead in ad spending »\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, one of Romney's chief rivals for the GOP nomination, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has spent nothing on television ads, but Giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition, while Romney does not.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the race for the Democratic nomination, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama has spent more than $2.3 million on television commercials, while New York Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent $1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls.\n",
      "\n",
      "New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has probably benefited the most in the Democratic contest from the $2 million he has invested in his television commercials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Richardson's humorous TV ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker, diplomat and executive, and positioned him as a solid second-tier candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Romney used his $8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to Republican voters. These voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal Massachusetts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Romney is leading polls in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further evidence of how Romney's television commercials have helped is in South Carolina.\n",
      "\n",
      "An American Research Group poll of South Carolina Republicans in August showed Romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters. A month later, and with $350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll, Romney was up 17 percentage points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Romney's latest ad began airing Friday in Iowa, and in it he vows to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, to boost the military by 100,000 people, to strengthen U.S. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the U.S. from al Qaeda.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the Iowa caucuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "While only a handful of Democratic candidates and Romney have used the airwaves until now, Tracey said he expects this to change.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Before the end of October, I suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air,\" Tracey said. \"As we get closer to primary day, the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last, best shot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fight for Congress, CMAG predicts that as much as $639 million could be spent on television advertising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats control the House and Senate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tracey noted that CMAG's 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former Florida Rep. Mark Foley's House page scandal or the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Politics is completely beholden to events,\" he said. \"Events will ultimately determine how much is spent, where and when.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Chances are, just as what happened in 2006, voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads,\" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. \"The sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance. After a while, the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise.\" E-mail to a friend###Assistant: -------------\n",

      "(CNN) -- Filmmaker Michael Moore, whose new documentary \"Sicko\" takes on America's health care system, faced off Tuesday with CNN chief medical correspondent and practicing neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"That's a lie. None of the facts are fudged.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Moore and Gupta shouted and argued over data Gupta used and data Moore used. Moore said his staffers backed up the film's facts to Gupta before the report aired and that Gupta aired it knowing his facts were wrong.\n",

      "Gupta disputed that.  Watch Moore, Gupta make their points »\n",

      "Both agreed, however, on the basic premise of \"Sicko\": Problems abound in America's health-care system and need to be fixed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought it was a good movie, and I wanted to say that,\" Gupta said. \"I think it strikes at the irrefutable fact -- it's broken. We get it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He praised Moore for raising awareness of the issue.\n",
      "\n",

      "While patients may not pay for services at the doctor's office, they do pay high taxes to fund such a system, something Gupta said he was concerned that \"Sicko\" audiences might not realize.\n",

      "(CNN) -- Explorer Dennis Schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near Greenland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fishermen pass by Greenland's Ilulissat fjord in this September 2004 picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity, even wonder perhaps, but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to Greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier. But such a large amount of ice melted, it revealed the distinct island.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I very quickly realized two things,\" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year. \"One [was] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The other thing was that it meant it was really happening. It wasn't a joke. It wasn't just statistics. It was really happening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He calls his discovery Warming Island.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's temperature, a trend widely called global warming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many global warming experts say the phenomenon, if unchecked, is capable of altering the world's climate and geography. In the worst-case scenario, experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels, flooding cities and altering seashores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other scientists and observers, a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous, say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet's life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere. But why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Earth's temperature averages about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (about 16 degrees Celsius).\n",
      "\n",
      "The average surface temperature has warmed one degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) during the last century, according to the National Research Council.\n",
      "\n",
      "The temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They rose till about 1945, cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say.\n",
      "\n",
      "A change in the Earth's orbit or the intensity of the sun's radiation could change, triggering warming or cooling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet's temperature at a comfortable level.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, for instance, has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, commonly referred to as the IPCC.\n",
      "\n",
      "The presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels, but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades, according to the EPA. Meanwhile, nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it,\" Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming,\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many scientific organizations share Schneider's view, ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the G8 to the National Research Council, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are those who do not share his view, and among the skeptics is Richard Lindzen, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves,\" he said. \"When we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970, we were proclaiming global cooling. Since then, there's been a few tenths of global warming, so we're proclaiming global warming.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability, where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Earth is always getting colder and warmer,\" he said. \"It's always changing. In fact, this is true of any fluid-covered planet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked about glacial melt, which many observers point to as evidence of global warming, Lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't know why, but it's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they've occurred,\" he said. \"What we're doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that's occurring due to global warming.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, for Schneider, it is a cause for concern and alarm. \"We're already in serious melt, nobody can explain it. The models don't predict it,\" he said. \"We don't know what's going on up there. All we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world's nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IPCC in February 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels, temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 4.5 degrees Celsius) by 2100.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes, droughts, wildfires and flooding, Schneider said. The higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of Hollywood filmmakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uncertainties, however, plague such forecasts, which are based on computer simulations and models. The models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere, oceans and continents interact, all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exactly how much it's going to warm up, we don't know,\" Schneider said. \"That it's going to warm up? I'd bet anything on that.\" E-mail to a friend###Assistant: -------------\n",

      "\n",
      "Stacy Peterson, 23, has been missing from her suburban Chicago home since October 28.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another development, a judge signed an order to exhume the body of Drew Peterson's third wife, who was found drowned in a bathtub in 2004, said Will County State Attorney James Glasgow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peterson, 53, said he last spoke to 23-year-old Stacy Peterson -- his fourth wife -- the night of October 28.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drew Peterson initially told the media he believed his wife ran off with another man, but he hasn't repeated that accusation. CNN has been unable to contact Drew Peterson for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The couple have been married four years and have two children, who have been interviewed for the investigation, Glasgow said. Drew Peterson also has older children from a previous marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investigators have twice searched the couple's home and vehicles, and removed several items, including computers, said Illinois State Police Capt. Carl Dobrich.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drew Peterson allowed a limited search on the night his wife was reported missing, but investigators were not allowed to look throughout the entire house and were given access to only one of the vehicles at that time, Dobrich said.\n",

      "In reality he was communicating with an undercover detective for the New York Police Department.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Washington museum posted a message on its Web site saying officials there are \"horrified\" by news of Singer's arrest. They reported that he has been suspended from his post, effective immediately, and is barred from the property.\n",
      "\n",
      "Singer, 49, was arrested at his home in Falls Church, Virginia, by federal agents, according to the prosecutors' statement. Authorities allege he engaged in several instant messaging \"chats\" and e-mail communications with the undercover detective, posing as the woman and her daughter, from August  to September.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is charged with five counts of distributing child pornography in interstate commerce. If convicted on each count, he would face a sentence of up to 140 years in prison -- up to 20 years for the first count and up to 40 years for each additional count, prosecutors said.\n",

      "In his communications with the supposed daughter, Singer pretended to be a 15-year-old boy, authorities said. In August 2007, he sent her two images featuring child pornography, according to the affidavit, with the instruction, \"just delete it when you are done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A search of Singer's AOL account activity showed that from July to September, he sent about 80 images featuring child pornography to people including the detective, authorities said in the statement. Also, the search revealed that he had received about 10 images and one video depicting child pornography.\n",

      "\"Take them off, fold the leg at the mark, and iron the fold,\" says Caroline Calvin, creative director of Levi's. \"Then cut just under the crease with fabric scissors. Lay the short jean leg on top of the other side and cut to evenly match.\"\n",

      "Repeat as needed to get the length you want. Ninety-degree days? Bring 'em on!\n",
      "\n",
      "The best way to catch fireflies --  How? With womanly wiles: \"Fireflies blink to attract a mate,\" explains naturalist Lynn Havsall, director of programs at the George B. Dorr Museum of Natural History, in Bar Harbor, Maine. \"Males fly around while females sit in trees, in shrubs, or on the ground. So find a female and watch her blinking pattern. Then imitate the pattern with a pen flashlight and the males will come to you.\"\n",

      "The best way to run on the beach -- Who needs a treadmill when you have miles of shoreline? Running on the beach can get you into great shape. Take it from lifeguard Benjamin Guss, 25, of Del Mar, California, who recently qualified to compete in this year's Iron Man triathlon (yes, that means swimming 2.4 miles, biking 112 miles, and then running a marathon -- consecutively) in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii.\n",

      "Beware, shoeless Joes. If you choose to run barefoot, keep your workouts brief at first to allow tender soles to build up calluses. \"You can get blisters, even burns, from hot, soft sand,\" says Guss.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I like to run barefoot, but for more than a couple miles, I wear shoes.\" Know your sand. \"In soft sand, one mile is like two,\" says Guss. You may work foot and leg muscles you don't always use, so start slowly. And hard sand can be as tough on your legs as the road, so wear running sneakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pick the right time to run. \"My favorite time is in the evening,\" says Guss. \"The wind dies down, and the sand isn't that hot.\"\n",

      "• Position your backside toward the hammock's center and tilt back until you reach a 45-degree angle, with the hammock parallel to your rear.\n",

      "For a graceful exit, sit upright and swing your legs off, anchoring your feet on the ground. Then push with your behind, gathering momentum to stand. \"It's tricky, since there's nothing to hold on to,\" says Waugh. \"But it's good for the glutes.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "• Cross and tie the laces once behind the ankle, then bring them forward, cross and tie again, and continue up the leg, depending on how long the laces are. The calf is the maximum height -- any higher and you'll look like a gladiator.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Each time you cross and tie, secure the laces slightly tighter than is comfortable, since they will loosen a bit when you walk. Just don't cut off your circulation.\n",

This school year, she says, 145 students are Iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 Iraqi children on a waiting list.  Watch Iraqi girls describe a long way from home »\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government policy: For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simply, this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked.\n",

      "\n",
      "As a result, the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for Iraqi families.\n",

      "The lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees' fears of being identified through their children's school records.\n",

      "(CNN) -- After weeks of controversy over Michael Mukasey's views on waterboarding, the Senate late Thursday approved the former judge's nomination for attorney general by a 53-40 vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Waterboarding threatened to derail the approval of President Bush's nominee to lead the Justice Department.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Bush nominated Mukasey to replace longtime ally Alberto Gonzales, who resigned in September.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nomination had been considered at risk after a number of Democratic senators opposed Mukasey because of questions that arose from his views on the terror interrogation technique known as waterboarding and the president's power to order electronic surveillance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mukasey, a former federal judge in New York, told senators he considers waterboarding \"repugnant,\" but he could not categorically say whether the technique amounts to torture, which U.S. and international law bans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Waterboarding is a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on him to produce the sensation of drowning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mukasey's confirmation was all but assured last week when two key Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee -- Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Chuck Schumer of New York -- said they would vote in favor of Mukasey despite the controversy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Department of Justice, once the crown jewel among government institutions, is adrift and rudderless,\" Schumer said Tuesday -- the same day the committee voted 11-8 to send Mukasey's nomination to the Senate floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It desperately needs a strong and independent leader at the helm to set it back on course and I believe Judge Mukasey is that person.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Schumer said that in a meeting Friday the nominee said that Congress would be within its rights to pass a law that bans waterboarding across all government agencies and that the president \"would have absolutely no legal authority to ignore\" it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Schumer said he believed Mukasey would be more likely to find waterboarding illegal than an interim attorney general.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, his written answers to our notices have demonstrated more openness to ending the practices we abhor than either of this president's previous attorney general nominees have.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mukasey's pledge to enforce such a law rang hollow with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the Judiciary Committee's chairman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Some have sought to find comfort in Judge Mukasey's personal assurance that he would enforce a future, new law against waterboarding if this Congress were to pass one,\" Leahy said Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unsaid, of course, is the fact that any such prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of this president.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said he believed Mukasey would enforce a law banning waterboarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He could have said a lot of things which would have given me more assurances,\" Specter said earlier. \"But he is intelligent; he's really learned in the law. He's strong, ethical, honest beyond any question. He's not an intimate of the president.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A majority of Americans consider waterboarding a form of torture, but some of those say it's OK for the U.S. government to use the technique, according to a poll released Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked whether they think waterboarding is a form of torture, more than two-thirds of respondents, or 69 percent, said yes; 29 percent said no. Asked whether they think the U.S. government should be allowed to use the procedure to try to get information from suspected terrorists, 58 percent said no; 40 percent said yes.\n",

      "(LiveWire) -- Voluble Gary Vaynerchuk, 31, the host of \"Wine Library TV,\" an online video show, has been known to lick rocks, suck leather and eat dirt while on camera, all to illustrate the unique properties of wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wine Library TV\" host Gary Vaynerchuk discusses four spooky wine varieties for Halloween show.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of a \"wild and gamey\" red from Rioja, Spain, Vaynerchuk says, \"Hit a deer on the road. Throw a bunch of cherries on it. Take out your knife, cut the deer. Bite it. That's the flavor profile.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That kind of attitude appeals to people who are mystified by the arcane lexicon of traditional wine journals or turned off by what they perceive as elitist barriers. Across the Internet, budding wine geeks are discovering a burgeoning number of Web sites, blogs, bulletin boards and other outlets that preach the gospel of the grape in terms they can understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 40,000 Internet viewers  -- many of them 20-somethings -- have a daily appointment with \"Wine Library TV.\" The low-budget video blog is produced five days a week from a nondescript office in the three-level wine retail operation that Vaynerchuk's family owns in Springfield, New Jersey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vaynerchuk has a discerning nose and palate, and he doesn't dumb down his subject. Yet he stuffs his patter with sports and pop-culture references -- and the kind of language a Wine Spectator critic would be unlikely to employ.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mission of wine sites like \"Wine Library TV,\" say several of the people behind these new outlets, is to demystify wine (and in some cases, sell it, too). Using the language, attitude and new media that appeal to a young, tech-savvy generation, they advocate trusting one's own palate rather than obeying powerful wine critics. Some of the sites also provide opportunities for average wine drinkers to share their opinions.\n",
      "\n",
      "One site, SavorEachGlass.com, declares its dedication to \"exploring the spirit of wine for a new generation,\" with reviews, online journals and essays that explain the finer points of winemaking  -- all with attitude. \"The (wine) establishment is about ratings and 'reputation,'\" says the site's founder, Tynan Szvetecz, 29. \"It's about collecting the 'good' stuff as defined by someone else's palate and tastes. That bores a younger generation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not afraid to be smartasses,\" he continues. \"We make fun of ourselves, old-world wine makers, new-world wine makers, and anyone else we can get our hands on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the U.S., interest in wine is exploding. While consumption has leveled out in traditional wine-producing countries such as France, Italy and Spain, especially among young people, it has trended upwards in the U.S. for 15 straight years. The U.S. is projected to overtake No. 2 Italy by the end of 2007, according to the annual report The U.S. Wine Market: Impact Databank Review and Forecast a leading industry trade publication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the new converts to wine are the so-called Millennials, the under-30 age group coveted by beverage marketers and so comfortable online that they're also called iGen, or the Internet Generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the wine Web sites targeting a younger demographic is VineSugar.com, which features a blog called \"Wine Burps.\" \"We love wine but hate the elitism,\" writes founder, Ryan O'Donnell. \"After all, it's just grape juice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With rants about wine tasting fees, a feature spotlighting \"wine hotties\" working at California wineries, as well as interactive maps that plot and rate wineries, VineSugar.com leaves little doubt about its target audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "CellarTracker.com, an online wine community, appeals to more established wine collectors. The site provides free software  -- designed by Eric LeVine, a fortuitously named former Microsoft software developer  -- that allows wine enthusiasts to create an online inventory of their wines.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 39,000 users (who count 6 million bottles in their virtual cellars) post reviews of their wines and access scores and other data via PDAs and cell phones. Community tasting notes shed light on how cellar-worthy wines are evolving, helping others decide when to crack open a treasured bottle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Corkd.com, another online community of wine fans, already had 40,000 users when Vaynerchuk purchased the site last year. The free service allows users to catalog and review wines. Instead of having \"friends\" as on Facebook, members identify \"drinking buddies\" and check out what they're drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the growing presence of wine fans on the Internet -- newbies as well as connoisseurs -- Vaynerchuk sees a movement. \"They're part of forums, they meet up (offline),\" he says. \"It's about bringing people together. It's all that's right about wine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vaynerchuk should know. The 300-plus shows he has taped in the past two years have developed a cult following of online fans, who call themselves \"Vayniacs,\" share wine tips and obsess about their hero on the site's forum.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a recent rainy afternoon, Vaynerchuk barreled, unrehearsed and unscripted, through a 20-minute show in a single take. He wrapped up Wine Library TV episode No. 337 with what has become his signature line.\n",

Watch Iraqi girls describe a long way from home »\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government policy: For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simply, this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The move is cementing a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than 2.2 million Iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland, most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria, according to humanitarian officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid Touqan says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year. That's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harb, on the front line of the phenomenon, says the influx is putting a strain on her school. Even with some U.N. and U.S. aid to Jordan, there's still not enough money.\n",

      "All say, though, that they feel lucky to have gotten out, even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move, ready to live far from home and away from loved ones.\n",

      "\"It's not strange for me to be in the middle of people I don't know,\" says eleventh grader Ziad Tarek Al Shamsi. \"I had friends in Iraq when I was small, I left them. In America, I left them. I came here, I left them.\"\n",

      "Even so, more than a month into the new academic year, fewer Iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year. According to the charity Save the Children, 21,000 Iraqi children have so far enrolled in Jordanian classrooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for Iraqi families.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees' fears of being identified through their children's school records.\n",

      "In a match played in torrential rain, Italy enjoyed the best possible start by taking the lead after just 70 seconds.

Di Natale swept the ball into the path of Toni who delicately flicked into the top left corner from six meters out.\n",

      "(InStyle) -- After years in the bronze age, when sun-kissed cheeks and gloss reigned supreme, fall's return to glamour means that lipstick is making a major comeback. Lipstick outsold gloss by $76 million last year, and beauty companies are racing to launch new formulas that are more wearable than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "So pucker up. We'll show you how to apply lipstick perfectly, along with the most flattering shades for day and night.\n",
      "\n",
      "For foolproof application, stick with sheer, subdued shades in the morning and save deep, bold colors (which require more time and precision) for night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daytime equation\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Condition and protect with a balm that contains sunscreen, like Softlips Raspberry with Green Tea SPF 20. \"Dab some on immediately after getting out of the shower, when your lips are still a little moist,\" suggests Hollywood pro Kara Yoshimoto Bua. The smoother your lips, the more perfect your lipstick will look.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Choose a soft shade such as rose or nude that you can apply straight from the tube. A hydrating formula ensures a smooth coat of color. Try Neutrogena Moistureshine Soothing Lipsheers in Fresh Rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Blot, reapply and blot again to remove excess oils and create a stain, says Bua. \"The color looks more natural and lasts longer.\" Instead of tissues, use lint-free blotting papers, like Boscia Fresh Blotting Linens ($10).\n",
      "\n",
      "Nighttime equation\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Exfoliate before applying a bold hue like red or burgundy. Sally Hansen Gentle Peel for Rough Lips ($10; at drugstores) uses fruit enzymes to remove dry patches.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Create a base with a gel-based primer that fills in fine lines around the mouth and helps lipstick go on more smoothly. One to try: Olay Regenerist lip treatment ($19; at drugstores).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Define the borders of your mouth with a pencil to prevent color from bleeding, says Robin Fredriksz, who gave Barrymore her deep fuchsia lip. To avoid an unnaturally dark outline, use a shade that's lighter than your lipstick, like Revlon Colorstay lip liner in Plum ($8; at drugstores).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Brush on color for more control. Try: Shu Uemura Kolinsky Portable Extra lipbrush ($35) with Isadora Perfect Moisture lipstick in Bordeaux Red ($11).\n",
      "\n",
      "Makeup artists' favorites\n",
      "\n",
      "Just like us, cosmetics pros use the same lipsticks again and again. From the just right daytime rose to the classic evening red, here are some of their all-time go-to picks for day and night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carmindy's neutral picks for day are designed to \"enhance your natural lip color.\" For night she recommends dark berry or true red for all skin tones. Her clients: Heidi Klum and Jamie-Lynn Sigler.\n",
      "\n",
      "Day shades: Benefit Silky Finish in Candy Store, $16; Givenchy Rouge Interdit in Secret Pink, $26.\n",
      "\n",
      "Night colors: Nars in Scarlet Empress, $23; Revlon Super Lustrous in Love That Red, $8; at drugstores.\n",
      "\n",
      "AJ Crimson likes a subtle pink or sheer beige for all skin tones during the day. For night he recommends bright red for fair complexions and a deep purple for darker ones. His clients: Missy Elliot and Amerie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Day shades: Chanel Rouge Hydrabase in Pink Sugar, $25; Laura Mercier in Candy Pink, ($22).\n",

      "Night colors: Maybelline Moisture Extreme in Royal Red, $7; at drugstores; MAC in Cyber, ($14).\n",

      "(InStyle.com) -- A hit TV show. An Emmy. A summer blockbuster. A new company. A wedding! Katherine Heigl has every reason to smile for our camera. A star -- and a trio of gorgeous looks -- is born.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ingénue: \"This is my favorite look of the three just because it's sexy but not overtly so,\" Heigl says. \"I like simple hair and makeup.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There has been a self-tanning mishap\n",
      "\n",
      "As Katherine Heigl crosses the parking lot of the sandwich shop at the Roosevelt Golf Course at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, she walks stiffly, holding her arms away from her like a paper doll and apologizing profusely for running 10 minutes late.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier, she'd sprayed her entire body with self-tanner, which refused to dry. She resorted to having her fiancé, musician Josh Kelley, take a blow-dryer to her (didn't work). So here she is, in a strapless, ankle-length Juicy Couture sundress (donned to accommodate the residual stickiness), fanning herself and wondering how mottled the tan will be when (or if) the lotion ever sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that one bum experience could turn her off beauty products.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I love everything new,\" says Heigl, 28, who, in addition to being nominated for an Emmy for best supporting actress on \"Grey's Anatomy,\" just started a production company at Fox. \"When I was in Rhode Island filming this summer, I went to Sephora for the first time. It was like my holy mecca.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She recently had her bathroom vanity renovated with a high counter to make more room for the large drawers below that hold her well-organized loot. Then there's her deal with Coty to be the face of Nautica's new women's fragrance in January.\n",
      "\n",
      "Considering this fondness for all things beauty -- as well as Heigl's impressive acting range -- she plays TV dramedy as deftly as cinematic romantic comedy, as in the mega-hit \"Knocked Up\" and next year's 27 Dresses -- it seems natural for her to be In Style's first ever triple-cover girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "These three looks take her from girl-next-door to red-carpet knockout to pixie-coiffed vamp. The star, whom pals call Katie (and Hollywood calls the Next Big Thing), popped out her retainer to talk about makeup, breakouts and what boys like.\n",
      "\n",
      "KATHERINE HEIGL: I'm so sorry, I have to take out my Invisalign before I eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "IN STYLE: Who knew you wore them? I guess that's the point of Invisalign.\n",
      "\n",
      "KH: I got them because of this wonky tooth. I was like, OK, I can't take it. It's awesome because every two weeks you switch to a new retainer. Pretty much the perfect way to describe Invisalign is Netflix for your teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "IS: Right -- the things we do for beauty. So, how did you like being transformed into three such different looks?\n",

      "\n",
      "IS: Do you ever go without makeup?\n",
      "\n",
      "KH: There was a time when I would. Now that I get followed by photographers, I'm really paranoid about it. I do not want to be the \"Look What This Celebrity Looks Like Without Makeup\" picture. I'm clearly vain, and I don't need that. Plus, I like products.\n",
      "\n",
      "IS: How often do you go through your drawers and purge?\n",
      "\n",
      "KH: Often, because people send me a lot of stuff now, which is exciting. I love getting those boxes. [Into the tape recorder:] Send me a box of makeup, Stila! When that happens, I feel like I have to clean out and give stuff to my sister, mom and friends because there comes a point of gluttony that I can't accept.\n",
      "\n",
      "IS: How do you think you express your personality through style?\n",
      "\n",
      "KH: I'm a big hair-up person. Last night at work they put my hair in two French braids to keep it flat under the scrub cap. I thought it looked cute and that I could pull it off after I'd slept on it. And ... no. So I thought I could recreate it myself ... no again.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as clothing style goes, I fluctuate almost as much as I do with beauty products. I like to shop for sweaters -- maybe it's the New Englander in me. I'm building a house in the mountains in Utah, so I tell myself I'm \"preparing\" for that. I like sweaters -- they're like scrubs -- you don't have to suck it in or worry about the bloat.\n",
      "\n",
      "IS: Do you know how you want your hair and makeup at your wedding?\n",
      "\n",
      "KH: I have an idea, but it's so dependent on the dress, and I haven't gotten there yet. My sister is getting married too, so we looked for dresses together. After about five stores I was like, \"I'm done.\" Everyone says, \"You just know when you put that dress on.\" My sister found the right dress just like that. So I know it can happen. But it's grueling.\n",
      "\n",
      "IS: Wait, so your mom has two daughters getting married within months?\n",
      "\n",
      "KH: My poor mother is probably like, \"Why, God? Why?\" But I hired a planner. I want the day to be spectacular, but mostly I want it to be fun. And I don't want to freak out or stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "IS: Does your fiancé have any particular opinions about your look?\n",
      "\n",
      "KH: Josh wouldn't mind if my hair was brown, if it was still long -- that's such a boy thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "IS: Would you ever wear a wig out?\n",
      "\n",
      "KH: I'd contemplate it, but I don't know if I actually have the courage to pull it off. I once wore a long hair-extension ponytail, and someone asked me if it was real, like I was one of those dolls when we were little, and the hair just cranks out.\n",
      "\n",
      "IS: How would you describe your skin?\n",
      "\n",
      "KH: My skin is sensitive, so everything bothers it. And I'm the jerk who keeps switching products and making it worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "IS: How do you treat a breakout?\n",
      "\n",
      "KH: I got a great product at Ona Spa called Sebuspot. I've tried so many that were disappointments, but maybe I stand too close to the mirror examining my pores. If I backed up, things might look fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "IS: What do you always carry in your bag?\n",
      "\n",
      "KH: Powder, because I get shiny. And lip balm, either the Smith's Rosebud Salve or C.O. Bigelow's Mentha Lip Shine in Black Cherry Soda from Bath & Body Works. It's shiny with a little shimmer and tastes so good.\n",
      "\n",
      "IS: An In Style.com reader wants to know how you maintain a healthy body image in Hollywood.\n",
      "\n",
      "KH: I train with Harley Pasternak. I love him with my whole soul and follow his 5-Factor diet. I first said, \"I'm never going to be -- nor do I want to be -- an uber-athletic girl.\" It's just not me and I don't have that kind of discipline. He said, \"I just want you to be healthy.\" A lot of what we focus on is posture. I slump into myself when I get stressed. If I were going to play an action hero, I'd have to get that look. But I'd never maintain it. For me it's never about achieving a look that's impossible. E-mail to a friend\n",

      "(Mental Floss) -- 1. The SPAM® Museum\n",
      "\n",
      "SPAM marks its 70th anniversary in 2007 which is also the Chinese Year of the Pig.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the on-site \"wall of SPAM\" is any indication, a tour through the SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, is guaranteed fun for the whole canned-pork-loving family. SPAM's parent company, Hormel Foods, opened the establishment in 2001 to the tune of almost 5,000 cans of SPAM.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the main attractions is a scale model of a SPAM plant, where visitors can don white coats and hairnets while pretending to produce America's favorite tinned meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. National Museum of Funeral History\n",
      "\n",
      "It's pretty hard to argue with the motto \"Any Day Above Ground is a Good One.\" So goes the backhanded optimism of the National Museum of Funeral History, a Houston facility that opened in 1992.\n",
      "\n",
      "Visitors are treated to exhibits that include a Civil War embalming display and a replica of a turn-of-the-century casket factory.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the museum boasts an exhibit of \"fantasy coffins\" designed by Ghanaian artist Kane Quaye. These moribund masterpieces include a casket shaped like a chicken, a Mercedes-Benz, a shallot, and an outboard motor. According to Quaye, his creations are based on the dreams and last wishes of his clients, which -- let's be honest -- really makes you wonder about the guy buried in the shallot.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The Hobo Museum\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're bumming around but looking for a good time, be sure to take a load off in Britt, Iowa, at The Hobo Museum, which details the history and culture of tramps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bear in mind, though, that the museum kind of, well, slacks on hours and is only open to the public during the annual Hobo Convention. Luckily, tours can be arranged by appointment any time of year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, if you're interested in the Hobo Convention, lodging is available all over the area, but it's a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the \"hobo jungle,\" located by the railroad tracks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the event and the museum are operated by the Hobo Foundation, which --incidentally -- also oversees the nearby Hobo Cemetery, where those who have \"caught the westbound\" are laid to rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The Mütter Museum\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally, the College of Physicians of Philadelphia erected the Mütter Museum as a creative way to inform medical students and practicing physicians about some of the more unusual medical phenomena. (You know, babies with two heads, that sort of thing.)\n",
      "\n",
      "But today, it primarily serves as a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque. There, you'll find the world's largest colon, removed from a man who died -- not surprisingly -- of constipation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also on display: an OB-GYN instrument collection, thousands of fluid-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens, and a large wall dedicated entirely to swallowed objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The Barnum Museum\n",
      "\n",
      "What better way to honor \"Greatest Show on Earth\" founder P.T. Barnum than with a mediocre museum in Bridgeport, Connecticut? Some visitors will appreciate the museum's ridiculously detailed miniature model of a five-ring circus.\n",
      "\n",
      "But only circus freaks (and by that we mean \"enthusiasts\") will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of Barnum's 40-inch-tall sidekick, General Tom Thumb.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The Conspiracy Museum\n",
      "\n",
      "There's more than one theory about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so why not have more than one museum devoted to it as well?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most JFK buffs are familiar with the Sixth Floor Museum housed in the former Texas School Book Depository, which recounts all those boring \"mainstream\" details of the late president's life leading up to his death at the hands of Lee Harvey Oswald.\n",
      "\n",
      "But just down the street, the Conspiracy Museum offers fodder for those less apt to buy into The Man's propaganda. For the most part, the museum specializes in showings of the Zapruder film and explanations of contrary assassination theories, including other gunmen on the grassy knoll and possible mafia involvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. The Museum of Questionable Medical Devices\n",
      "\n",
      "Take two trips to the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices and call us when you've lost all faith in the medical profession.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to curator Bob McCoy (who recently donated the collection to the Science Museum of Minnesota), those in search of history's quack science can find what they're looking for in the St. Paul tourist attraction, whether it's a collection of 19th-century phrenology machines or some 1970s breast enlargers.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you make the trip, be sure to check out the 1930s McGregor Rejuvenator. This clever device required patrons to enclose their bodies, sans head, in a large tube where they were pounded with magnetic and radio waves in attempts to reverse the aging process.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Cook's Natural Science Museum\n",
      "\n",
      "What began as a training facility for Cook's Pest Control exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the country willing to tell the tale of the pest.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Cook's Natural Science Museum in Decatur, Alabama, visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats, cockroaches, mice, spiders, and termites ... all for free.\n",
      "\n",
      "And while most people would rather step on the live specimens than learn about them, museum exhibits such as the crowd-pleasing Pest of the Month keep reeling in patrons.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what do you get when you combine the loneliness of a pet cemetery with the creepy flair of vaudeville? The Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum, of course -- where dummies go to die.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, museum was the brainchild of the late William Shakespeare Berger, who founded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets. In fact, he collected figures from some of the country's most famous ventriloquist acts.\n",
      "\n",
      "And with more than 700 dummies stacked from floor to ceiling, you're bound to feel like you're stuck inside a 1970s horror flick -- albeit a really good one.\n",
      "\n",
      "But sadly, when Berger gave the tour, you could totally tell his mouth was moving.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. The Trash Museum\n",
      "\n",
      "Mom wasn't kidding when she said one man's trash is another man's treasure. At the Trash Museum in Hartford, Connecticut, the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority (CRRA) turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment! T\n",
      "\n",
      "our the Temple of Trash or visit the old-fashioned town dump.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for your recycler-in-training, head across the state to the Children's Garbage Museum, where you can take an educational stroll through the giant compost pile, get a glimpse of the 1-ton Trash-o-saurus, or enjoy the company of resident compost worms. E-mail to a friend\n",

      "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Attacks are down 75 percent in recent months in a perilous stretch of neighborhoods in northeastern Baghdad, prompting a U.S. military officer to proclaim Monday that security there is \"dramatically improving.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Concerned citizens have helped troops improve security in parts of Baghdad, a military official says.\n",
      "\n",
      "People line the streets, cars congest them, trash collectors and other city workers have returned, local leaders are holding community meetings again and \"markets have come back like gangbusters,\" said Army Col. Don Farris, commander of 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division.\n",
      "\n",
      "He added that the largely Sunni al Qaeda in Iraq presence has been \"crushed\" since the beginning of May.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are still dangers, most notably the threats posed by Iranian-backed Shiite militants, Farris said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking to Pentagon reporters via video link from Baghdad, Farris cited several factors he said contributed to the improving security situation. Among them is the \"surge,\" the additional U.S. troops deployed earlier this year.  Watch how old rivalries have been posing problems »\n",
      "\n",
      "Also helping improve the security situation are the cease-fire by radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army and the development of a program that employs \"concerned local citizens\" to assist U.S. and Iraqi forces, Farris said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of those citizens are members of local Sunni \"awakening councils,\" comprised of former militants -- often armed -- who create neighborhood watch groups to root out the insurgent elements in an area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Especially in the last six weeks, Farris said, civic and religious leaders have seen outsiders operating in the area and troops have made arrests, two Iranian operatives among them\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From my foxhole, in our sector, it is working,\" he said of the improving security in the area. \"I can only speak to what I see in my sector and I am encouraged.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Farris' sector -- which includes the Sunni-dominated district of Adhamiya and Sadr City, the Shiite slum where militants have demonstrated a strong presence -- has seen a \"remarkable turnaround,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the communities in his area have been wracked with sectarian warfare and terrorized by insurgents and death squads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite improvements in the security situation, Farris warned that \"we still have a lot of work to do\" because there doesn't appear to be any sign that Shiite extremists with links to Iran are halting their activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farris said troops also are still finding explosively formed penetrators, which are often delivered or manufactured by Iran. Nine such bombs were found in late October, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are intelligence reports indicating weapons and money are still flowing into Sadr City, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also problems returning refugees and displaced people to their homes in the area, Farris said, because \"essential services\" like water and electricity are not yet up to snuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though a \"trickle\" of families has returned home and many are asking when they can return, Farris said he believes residents will return en masse only when basic services are in better shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Folmsbee, a State Department provincial reconstruction team leader, said at the same news conference that his personnel was handling development issues involving law, governance, economic development and essential services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farris' Monday remarks echo a string of similar assertions made by U.S. and Iraqi military officials over recent weeks. The military officials say they are seeing signs of Sunni-Shiite reconciliation.\n",
      "\n",

      "She was found Friday with family in Las Vegas after thousands of tips poured in, thanks to an appeal by police to the news media to show the girl's picture. CNN and other news organizations did so until the child was found, when De Meo asked them to stop showing the picture.\n",
      "\n",

      "A former Las Vegas animal trainer, Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, has been identified as a suspect and is being sought in the case, De Meo said. Pahrump is about 60 miles west of Las Vegas.  Watch what's known about Stiles »\n",

You will not be forgotten by members of this agency or any other law enforcement agency.\"   The FBI is also seeking Stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 in a separate matter, De Meo said.\n",

      "\"Nothing that I have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through. Whoever this person is is a predator that, as far as I'm concerned, belongs in custody and, if successfully prosecuted, in jail for as long as the law allows,\"  De Meo said earlier.  Detectives said the child showed little emotion during the rapes, indicating she may have been brutalized before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevadan Darren Tuck recently gave police the videotape, saying he found it in the desert, De Meo said. Police said the tape was in his possession at least since May before he handed it over to authorities. He is being sought on a parole violation for failure to pay child support, but police -- who want to question him further -- have been unable to locate him.\n",
      "\n",

      "(Mental Floss) -- They say a lot of artistic expression is motivated by self-loathing. But not for these folks! Long before the Material Girl ordered papa to stop preaching, these six puffed-up virtuosos knew darn well how to strike a pose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alfred Hitchcock didn't leave people in suspense about how he felt about actors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's to the creative types who managed to raise egotism to an art form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alfred Hitchcock\n",
      "\n",
      "Hitchcock was, without question, one of the towering geniuses of cinema. And, like many greats, he wasn't exactly the best collaborator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hitchcock was particularly trying for screenwriters, who felt he never properly credited them for their work. But he was notoriously hard on actors.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was once quoted as saying, \"Actors are cattle\" -- a quip that stirred up a huge outcry (actors can be so touchy). In response, he issued this correction: \"I have been misquoted. What I really said is, 'Actors should be treated as cattle.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Although it began accidentally (when he was short an actor for the film \"The Lodger\"), Hitchcock soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films, amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ayn Rand\n",
      "\n",
      "The egotist's egotist, author Ayn Rand (born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum) is the patron saint of Thinking You're Better Than Everybody Else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her most famous novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, are massive dramatizations of Objectivism, her self-spun Oscar-the-Grouch philosophy for success. Objectivism champions ego and accomplishment, shuns all religion as folly, and condemns any form of charity or altruism as counterproductive to society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rand's novels often focus on protagonists (invariably men) who are shunned by others because of their genius, but then persevere over the foolishness of morons to prove said genius and emerge triumphant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not surprisingly, she saw humility as a weakness and regarded laughing at yourself as \"spitting in your own face.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, just how much did Rand believe in her own philosophy? Let's just say a lot. With signature modesty, she ranked herself as the philosophical equal of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Orson Welles\n",
      "\n",
      "When you create a cinematic masterpiece such as \"Citizen Kane\" at the ripe old age of 25, you're bound to get a big head. But Welles was convinced of his own importance much earlier than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, \"Citizen Kane\" might have been sparked by nothing more than a bruised ego. After all, it's said he devised the film as a withering exposé of newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst because Hearst slighted Welles at a dinner party. Of course, after the unparalleled success of \"Citizen Kane,\" Welles's arrogant side didn't get any less subtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do yourself a favor: Track down a recording of Welles' outtakes for a TV commercial for frozen peas. You'll hear everything you need to know about the filmmaker's oversized ego. A classic quote goes: \"In the depths of your ignorance, what is it you want?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank Lloyd Wright\n",
      "\n",
      "As the brains behind the Robie House, Fallingwater, Taliesin West, the Guggenheim, and countless other design benchmarks, Frank Lloyd Wright is arguably the genius of 20th-century architecture. And, boy, did he know it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Wright was notorious for believing he was superior to mere mortals. In fact, the architectural egomaniac frequently acted as though the rules -- even those of geography and climate -- did not apply to him. But when you're Wright, you're right.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1935, department store magnate Stanley Marcus (of Neiman-Marcus fame) commissioned the architect to design his Dallas home, but the project quickly went sour. Wright's avant-garde floor plan included \"sleeping porches\" that required his client to sleep outdoors year-round. In addition, Marcus' small bedroom \"cubicles\" came equipped with almost no closet space.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Stanley respectfully explained that (a) temperatures during summer nights in Dallas often exceed 80 degrees and (b) a high-fashion tastemaker might need bigger closets, Wright threw a series of tantrums.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately for the voyeur in us all, said tantrums usually took place in letter form. Preserved and occasionally displayed at the Dallas Museum of Art, they make for delicious reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Salvador Dalí\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Every morning when I awake, the greatest of joys is mine: that of being Salvador Dalí.\" Yup, he actually said that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything about the legendary Surrealist painter (he of the melting clocks) -- from his whacked-out paintings to his curled-up mustache -- was designed to shock, destroy convention, cause scandal, and stir controversy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Criticized for choosing to live under General Franco's fascist government in Spain, Dalí defended his position by stating that he didn't care about others so long as he could be king. Not exactly a man of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he wasn't getting enough attention, he was known to walk the streets of New York City clanging a hand bell. Of course, this is also the guy who once said, \"The thought of not being recognized [is] unbearable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Need another telling quote? \"At the age of 6 years, I wanted to be a chef. At the age of 7, I wanted to be Napoleon. My ambitions have continued to grow at the same rate ever since.\" Apparently, so did his ego.\n",
      "\n",
      "Al Jolson\n",
      "\n",
      "Plenty of performers this side of Gallagher have been labeled \"the world's greatest entertainer.\" But Al Jolson really, really believed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vaudeville singer, actor, dancer, and comedian was born Asa Yoelson in Seredzius, Lithuania, in what was then part of Imperial Russia. As a performer, he was known for hijacking the action in the middle of shows, ad-libbing, or just stopping to talk to the audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a 1911 performance of the critically hated \"Paris is a Paradise for Coons\" (title not edited for political correctness), Jolson stopped and asked the audience if they'd rather hear him sing than see the rest of the play. The crowd roared with applause, and Jolson ditched the whole program and took over. From that moment on, no one else could share the stage with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike some of the egomaniacs on this list, however, Jolson can be forgiven somewhat for his arrogance. According to most contemporary accounts, he actually was the greatest in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, despite the enormity of his contributions to stage and screen, Jolson's legacy has become a political hot potato because of his use of stage blackface (considered highly offensive now, but pretty common at the time). E-mail to a friend\n",

      "\n",
      "Jonathan Evans, the chief of MI5, also said that at least 2,000 people in Britain pose a threat to the country's security because of their support for al Qaeda-inspired terrorism.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As I speak, terrorists are methodically and intentionally targeting young people and children in this country. They are radicalising, indoctrinating and grooming young, vulnerable people to carry out acts of terrorism,\" he told a gathering of newspaper editors in Manchester.\n",

      "Evans said the figure of 2,000 -- an increase of 400 since November 2006 -- only included those the intelligence services knew about and that the actual number could be double.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said there had been 200 terrorist convictions in Britain since the September 11 attacks.\n",

      "The MI5 head added that over recent years much of the command and inspiration for attack planning in the UK had come from al Qaeda's remaining core leadership in the tribal areas of Pakistan.\n",

      "SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- You must know what's really driving the immigration debate. It's the culture, stupid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ruben Navarrette Jr.: Some opponents of immigration, even the legal kind, fear changes in local culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immigration restrictionists -- and by that, I mean those who want to limit all immigration, even the legal kind -- like to pretend they're so high-minded. Yet they can't help themselves. They always take the low road and harken back to the nativism that greeted earlier waves of immigrants.\n",
      "\n",
      "The restrictionists insist that what bothers them are merely practical concerns: that our borders aren't secure, that so many immigrants are coming into the country illegally, and that the new arrivals are burdening schools and draining social services once they get here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really? If that's the extent of it, then why does the conversation quickly turn to the impact -- both real and perceived -- that immigrants have on American culture through everything from taco trucks to Spanish-language billboards.\n",
      "\n",
      "That seems to be the issue in North Dakota, where, according to a recent article in USA Today, towns facing tough economic times are nonetheless resisting a cultural transfusion that could save them. In Cooperstown, the locals opposed efforts to bring in a hog plant and a dairy, because those kind of dirty and hard jobs are likely to attract ... guess who? American kids who work at Starbucks? Nope.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article quotes Orville Tranby, a local community leader in Cooperstown, who says that some residents have told him \"face to face\" that such facilities might attract Hispanic immigrants who could change the local culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll find the same fear in Lewisburg, Tennessee. Not long ago, an employee at a local library came up with the radical idea of a bilingual story time where children could hear tales read to them in Spanish. Townspeople wanted no part of that. They demanded that all books purchased by the library, or even donated, be in English-only.\n",
      "\n",
      "These stories are ridiculous, but they're also helpful. They illustrate what some people are really concerned about with immigration, and it goes well beyond words like \"legal\" or \"illegal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's the perception that the country is becoming more Hispanic, that Spanish is replacing English, that Hispanic immigrants are weakening American identity, and that Main Street is turning into Little Mexico. A leader of the vigilante Minuteman movement moronically called it the \"colonization\" of the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "This sort of rhetoric is all about fear -- that those who thrive in the dominant culture are losing their primacy, that the mainstream is being polluted by foreigners, and that our children are going to live in a world where they're going to have to work a lot harder to keep up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It conjures up the alarm bells that Benjamin Franklin set off about German immigrants in the late 18th century, who he insisted could never adopt the culture of the English, but would \"swarm into our Settlements, and by herding together establish their Language and Manners to the Exclusion of ours.\" It popped up in the mid-19th century amid worries that Chinese immigrants were \"unassimilable,\" which led to Congress approving the explicitly-named Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. And it helped welcome the 20th century when Massachusetts Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge warned that immigrants (read: the Irish) were diluting \"the quality of (U.S.) citizenship\" and others complained that Italian immigrants were uneducated, low skilled, apt to send all their money to their home country and prone to criminal activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where have we heard that before? And when will we hear it again? After all, Hispanics may be the latest group to find themselves in a culture war with nativists. But they won't be the last.\n",

      "YouTube appeared to have removed 89 videos linked to his account, many of them featuring Nazi imagery, shortly after the incident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finnish media reported someone posted a message two weeks ago on the Web site, warning of a bloodbath at the school.\n",
      "\n",
      "A video posted earlier Wednesday, by \"Sturmgeist89,\" was titled \"Jokela High School Massacre - 11/7/2007.\" \"Sturmgeist89\" identified himself as Auvinen, and said he chose the name \"Sturmgeist\" because it means \"storm spirit\" in German.\n",
      "\n",
      "The video showed a picture of the school, which then disintegrated to reveal two images of Auvinen against a red background, pointing a gun at the screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clip is accompanied by the song \"Stray Bullet\" from rock band KMFDM. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the students behind the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, also cited that group's lyrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another short video clip, called \"Just Testing My Gun,\" showed Auvinen loading and cocking a handgun. He fired and hit several pieces of fruit in a wooded area; the camera then showed a close-up of the destroyed fruit, and then a full-screen shot of him again. He waved at the camera and then walked out of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "The site indicated that the youth appeared to be fascinated with killing. As well as video footage of the Columbine school shootings, it also included clips of the 1993 Waco siege in the United States, the 1995 sarin gas attack in Tokyo, and bombs falling on Baghdad during the 2003 invasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many showed victims being wheeled away or people running for their lives. Throughout all of this, the single word \"DIE\" constantly flashed across the screen. Other video clips included Nazi-war-criminal footage.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the rambling text posted on the site, Auvinen said that he is \"a cynical existentialist, anti-human humanist, anti-social social-Darwinist, realistic idealist and god-like atheist.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am prepared to fight and die for my cause,\" he wrote. \"I, as a natural selector, will eliminate all who I see unfit, disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection.\"\n",

      "They described the scene as chaotic, with some of the 460 students, ranging in age from 12 to 18, breaking windows in an attempt to escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the police's special SWAT unit entered the high school they found the gunman unconscious and in critical condition in the lower lobby of the building with a gunshot wound to his head. Police assume he tried to take his own life as no officers fired at him.  Several bodies were also found in the same location, where the shooting is believed to have begun, they added.\n",
      "\n",
      "They could not confirm comments by some students that Auvinen was firing through doors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Police also said that the gun Auvinen used, which was fully licensed, had been purchased less than a month ago on October 19. The legal age limit to own a gun in Finland is 18, which Auvinen passed in June of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a recommendation from a shooting club when he obtained the gun, police added, and practised sharp-shooting as a hobby at a shooting range.\n",

      "(CNN) -- Polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs tried to hang himself earlier this year while he was in jail awaiting trial, according to court documents unsealed by a Utah judge on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sect leader Warren Jeffs arrives in court to hear the verdict against him September 25 in St. George, Utah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeffs, the leader and so-called prophet of the 10,000-member Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is now awaiting sentencing after being convicted on two counts of being an accomplice to rape.\n",
      "\n",
      "The documents, released by Fifth District Judge James Shumate at the request of the media, also indicate that Jeffs confessed to \"immorality\" with a \"sister\" and a daughter more than 30 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the documents is a competency report on Jeffs completed in April, in which social worker Eric Nielsen wrote that throughout the month of January, Jeffs refused food and drink and developed ulcers on his knees from kneeling in prayer for hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "On January 28, the report said, he attempted to hang himself in his cell. In the days following the suicide attempt, while he was on suicide watch, Jeffs on separate occasions threw himself against the wall and banged his head on the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jail transcripts show that Jeffs' suicide attempt came three days after a visit with his brother, Nephi, in which he said, \"I am not the prophet. I never was the prophet, and I have been deceived by the powers of evil ... I ask for everyone's forgiveness.\" Jeffs also told his brother: \"Farewell forever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The day before that, Jeffs told a follower in a phone conversation that he was \"covered with immorality with a sister and a daughter when I was younger.\" In the FLDS, members call adult women \"sister,\" and Jeffs' meaning was unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeffs' defense attorneys, who argued against the release of the documents, said in a motion opposing the unsealing of the statements that Jeffs recanted them the following month. Defense attorneys claim Jeffs' medical condition influenced his state of mind when the statements were made.\n",
      "\n",
      "They presented Shumate with a letter from another Jeffs attorney, arguing that the statements' release could influence an Arizona jury when Jeffs stands trial in that state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeffs, 51, was convicted in September of being an accomplice to rape. He was accused of using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marriage to her 19-year-old cousin. He faces a sentence of up to life in prison when he is sentenced November 20.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FLDS -- which is not affiliated with the mainstream Mormon church -- is based in the side-by-side border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. Jeffs, a former school headmaster, is the son of the sect's previous president and \"prophet,\" Rulon Jeffs, who died in 2002.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeffs was on the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives list when he was arrested in August 2006 outside Las Vegas, Nevada.\n",
      "\n",
      "Critics say that inside the FLDS, marriages are arranged for girls as young as 13, and competition for brides may be reduced by exiling male teens and young men. If male followers are excommunicated, critics claim, wives and children can be reassigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "During Jeffs' trial, defense attorneys claimed authorities were persecuting Jeffs because of his religious beliefs, including practicing polygamy as the way to heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Jeffs disavowed being the prophet of the FLDS, it could cause upheaval within the secretive sect. However, two of his followers who spoke to CNN -- although FLDS members usually do not talk to reporters -- said they do not believe he made the statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is a perfectly priestly man,\" said a woman who identified herself as Cathy. \"He is a man of God, and we will always love him. Once a prophet, always a prophet.\"\n",

      "LONDON, England (CNN) -- There are some circuits that are cornerstones of the Formula 1 calendar: the Monacos and Silverstones whose every twist and turn are known intimately by the drivers and engineers. Then there are the newer circuits -- Malaysia and Bahrain, for instance -- but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fuji Speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next week they have something completely new to contend with: a track that has yet to see a single F1 team put in a single lap. The Japan Grand Prix is to return to the Fuji Speedway, a circuit that hasn't seen an F1 race since 1977 (though now with a substantially different track layout).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fuji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games. The old Fuji Speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game Pole Position (released by Namco in Japan and Atari in the rest of the world). The most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest mountain, looming in the distance. Though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Suzuka track -- which had held Japanese Grands Prix between 1987 and 2006 -- had been popular with drivers and fans alike, but for this year and the next the Japanese Grand Prix will be held at Fuji.\n",
      "\n",
      "However an announcement by Formula One Management (FOM) this month revealed that Suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009 -- on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications -- with the location of the Japanese Grand Prix alternating yearly between Fuji and Suzuka after that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind the scenes is a political battleground -- both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with F1 connections -- Honda owns Suzuka, Toyota owns Fuji. Toyota is a relative newcomer to F1 but, having this year surpassed General Motors as the world's number one automobile manufacturer, and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock (a position that hasn't been reflected in sporting success), it is not without clout.\n",
      "\n",
      "The redesign of the Fuji track was carried out by Hermann Tilke in 2003. Tilke, a German architect redesigned a number of F1 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including Malaysia, Istanbul, Bahrain and Shanghai, and the tracks for 2008's debut grands prix in Singapore and Valencia.\n",
      "\n",
      "So how do F1 teams prepare for a new circuit such as Fuji without data from previous races to fall back on? The answer lies with computer simulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Computer-aided design (CAD) is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the high-tech cars. Every bend, every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite never having raced on the circuit, the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual Fuji Speedway for some time. BMW Sauber's simulation experts received CAD data from the Japanese race organizers late last year. And when their cars arrive at Fuji for testing next week, their race set-up should be close to optimum.\n",
      "\n",
      "The circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments. The radius of each individual segment was measured, allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line (the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance).\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated. The slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend, we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels, gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance,\" says Willy Rampf, Technical Director of the BMW Sauber F1 Team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dieter Glass, Chief Race and Test Engineer with Toyota F1 explains:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit. Once you know that, you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce, before you get into more detailed simulations of different set-up solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Getting a bit closer to the weekend, you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy. This prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track, like the degradation of the two Bridgestone tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time. If you have more fuel in the car, this affects your lap time, but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One peculiarity of the Fuji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight, which at 1.475 km (0.916 miles) will allow for higher-than average-straight line speeds but, after the straight the track is relatively twisty. The teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight, and the best grip decelerating into the bends.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip,\" says Glass, \"and as always you want good grip in general, but you have to balance that with the long straight, where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The testing may be virtual, but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hair's breadth away from real world eventualities:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values,\" says Rampf.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that everything can be predicted: \"I think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race,\" continues Glass.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"There's absolutely no reason that the veterans' bill could not have been signed by the president today, except for the political games that the Democrats decided to play with it,\" White House press secretary Dana Perino said Sunday in Crawford, Texas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Congressional Democrats had attached legislation funding veterans programs to a $150.7 billion bill that also funded a number of domestic priorities, including health, labor and education. Democrats also added $3.7 billion to what the president budgeted for veterans programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The labor-health-education bill would increase funding by more than $10 billion over last year's funding for those programs. The president has threatened to veto the bill because of the added spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "The House passed a health-labor-education bill 269-142 last week with the veterans funding attached, but the Senate later voted to strip out the veterans funding and send the health-labor-education bill to the president.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perino accused the Democrats of \"trying to hold hostage our veterans to extra domestic spending or increases in taxes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The president wants clean legislation, a clean bill to fund the veterans,\" Perino said.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Saturday, the Democratic congressional leadership sent a letter to President Bush saying they welcomed a dialogue on spending, sayings disagreements over funding levels \"have never been so great that we cannot reach agreement on a spending plan that meets the needs of the American people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Key to this dialogue, however, is some willingness on your part to actually find common ground,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said in the letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The leadership said last year's Congress, which was still under Republican control, had never passed a separate bill funding veterans programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Congress also sent to the president legislation that would fund veterans care at the levels requested by the president through December 14, the leadership said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current funding level \"is still below the $3.9 billion extra that we passed,\" said Nadeam Elshami, spokesman Pelosi. \"We are committed to getting the extra funding that the Congress already voted on the president's desk for his signature.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The leadership blamed Republican members of Congress for stalling the funding for the veterans programs by blocking its inclusion in the larger spending bill.\n",

      "NEW ALBANY, Indiana (CNN) -- President Bush vetoed a $600 billion spending bill Tuesday, accusing Democratic leaders of wasting money and plotting tax increases, then took his budget fight with Congress on the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "Congress should cut spending \"and send me a responsible measure that I can sign into law,\" President Bush said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The majority was elected on a pledge of fiscal responsibility, but so far, it's acting like a teenager with a new credit card,\" he said in a speech in New Albany, Indiana.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bill -- which Bush said was laden with $10 billion in \"pork\" -- would have funded the departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services. It also would have funded projects such as a prison museum, a sailing school and a program to teach Portuguese.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Congress needs to cut out that pork, reduce the spending and send me a responsible measure that I can sign into law,\" the president said.  Watch a report on the veto »\n",
      "\n",
      "While polls show Bush's popularity remains at near-record lows, Congress ranks even lower as a whole. The president has taken numerous opportunities to mock the spending habits of the Democratic leadership and force confrontations over the appropriations bills needed to fund the government for the 2008 budget year, which began October 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bill Bush vetoed Tuesday includes about $150 billion to run those departments and more than $450 billion in mandatory spending on Medicare and Medicaid, the federal health care programs for the elderly and poor, according to the House Appropriations Committee. The committee's chairman, Rep. David Obey, called Bush's veto \"not responsible and not credible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a bipartisan bill supported by over 50 Republicans,\" Obey, D-Wisconsin, said in a statement issued after the veto. \"There has been virtually no criticism of its contents. It is clear the only reason the president vetoed this bill is pure politics.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bush said Democrats are supporting $22 billion in additional spending beyond his budget proposals this year and $205 billion over five years -- money he said would ultimately be raised by tax increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When the bill for all that spending comes due, Congress is going to turn to the working people, to the small-business owners and the entrepreneurs,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuesday's veto is the fifth cast since Democrats took control of Congress in 2006. Congress has overridden one of those, voting last week to authorize $23 billion in water projects nationwide over the president's objections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Democrats will schedule another override vote this week, an aide to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said. But Antonia Ferrier, spokeswoman for House Republican Whip Roy Blunt, said Bush's GOP allies are confident they will be able to sustain the veto.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bush signed a $470 billion Pentagon spending bill that covers the Defense Department's normal operations, but Democrats split $50 billion in spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan off into a \"bridge fund\" to which they plan to attach demands for Bush to withdraw U.S. combat troops. The measure sets up another confrontation with the White House.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bush also demanded Congress reform the alternative minimum tax -- a measure originally aimed at preventing the wealthy from evading taxes, but one that increasingly affects middle-class earners -- without raising additional revenue. He said a plan proposed by Rep. Charles Rangel, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to eliminate the tax was unacceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Preventing a tax increase in one area should not be an excuse for raising taxes in other areas,\" he said. \"Congress should eliminate the tax increases in the bill and send the AMT relief to my desk as soon as possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The elimination of the tax would cause an estimated $800 billion to be lost over 10 years. To replace that, Rangel's bill would add a 4 percent surtax on individual incomes over $100,000, after deductions, and close corporate tax loopholes. The bill also would cut rates for many individual and corporate taxpayers. Republicans have already started calling it \"the mother of all tax increases.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With all the other pressures on our economy, raising taxes is one of the most unwise things Congress could possibly do,\" Bush said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bush acknowledged the difficulties Americans face from high fuel prices, a \"challenged\" housing market and \"uncertainty\" in financial markets stemming from the collapse of the subprime mortgage market -- \"but as we have seen in recent years, this economy is resilient, and that's important for the American people to understand.\" E-mail to a friend\n",

      "DENVER, Colorado -- A Colorado man terrorized by threats after testifying against his daughter's abusive boyfriend says he has spent $10,000 on a security system, hired a bodyguard for his son's wedding and never leaves home without a .45-caliber handgun strapped to his chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keith Reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case, says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of Keith Reynolds for domestic abuse -- even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family.\n",
      "\n",
      "A report in the Denver Post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of Colorado. Paul Logli, chairman of National District Attorneys Association, told Congress this year that witness intimidation has become \"almost epidemic,\" according to the Denver Post.\n",
      "\n",
      "When asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of Colorado's witness protection program, the witness in the Reynolds case said, \"All they told us was maybe we should move.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm pretty sure I told one of them -- either him or his wife -- about the program. I can't remember if I gave them all the details.\" the prosecutor assigned to the case, who didn't want to be named, told CNN.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Reynolds' conviction, the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home. They received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being cocked. The couple received a death threat from Reynolds himself through the mail. Watch witness describe fear of being targeted »\n",
      "\n",
      "Reynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation. However, it is likely he'll be released within five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "No national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist, and minimal research has been conducted on the subject. The latest National Institute of Justice survey on record -- conducted more than a decade ago -- shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colorado has $50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget. In contrast, the city of Denver spent almost $100,000 on landscaping last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The state, on average, spends about $1,000 per witness. That figure supposedly includes moving expenses, rent, and furniture. The federal program spends in excess of $40 million per year on witness protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "One possible reason for the disparity is that witnesses in state cases do not get new identities, as do federal witnesses. \"It's not designed to be a long-term relocation at the public's expense; it's a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses,\" according to Peter Weir, executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colorado's witness protection program is a \"joke,\" according to The Rev. Leon Kelly, founder and executive director of the Open Door Youth Gang Alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelly says the state doesn't provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward. More than a decade ago, a young man named Darryl Givens asked Kelly for advice while deciding whether to testify in a murder case or face prison. Givens chose to testify. A few months later, he was shot twice in the head by men he considered friends. That day continues to haunt Kelly.\n",

He had plans to move east when a Fourth of July barbecue in 2004 in changed all that. He witnessed the murder of his best friend and subsequently testified against three men suspected in the killing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Javad Fields and his fiancee were gunned down while driving along a suburban street in Aurora, Colorado. The couple, both 22, died instantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rhonda Fields says her son was never told about a witness protection program. She confronted prosecutors after his murder. Fields told CNN, \"I asked them what happened. Why weren't any measures taken to safeguard his life? And I was told he never asked for any protection.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Javad's mother does not think it was her son's responsibility to ask for protection. \"I think it's the authorities' responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Field's case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program. Prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting Javad Fields' personal information be kept secret, but it wasn't signed by a judge until one year later, after defense lawyers had already given the suspects Fields' personal information, along with crucial trial documents.\n",

      "\n",
      "On Friday, Sanchez, who was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004, called the Iraq war \"a nightmare with no end in sight.\" He said the Bush administration, the State Department and Congress all share blame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking with military reporters in Virginia, Sanchez also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial, but the politicians have not been held accountable.\n",

      "But Graham said that \"finally,\" with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional U.S. troops since January, \"We are getting it right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanchez told reporters that American political leaders have cost American lives on the battlefield with their \"lust for power.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanchez said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty, but that he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired.\n",

      "\"While the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power, our soldiers die,\" he said.\n",

      "\"I wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time,\" McCain told CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" He said Sanchez should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but \"unfortunately, that doesn't happen very often.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the reasons few speak out, he said, is evidenced by what happened to former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki, McCain said. Shinseki was sidelined after telling Congress that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy Iraq.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, told ABC's \"This Week\" that Sanchez is simply wrong. \"My definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on terror,\" he said. \"I think we're making significant progress toward that end.\"\n",

      "ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (CNN) -- The acrimony from the Republican campaign trail carried over quickly into the CNN/YouTube GOP presidential debate Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The debate marked the first time the candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "With five weeks to go until the first contest of the 2008 nominating season, the Republican candidates engaged in a free-for-all, trying to differentiate their views on immigration, the Iraq war, abortion, gun control and even whether they believed every word in the Bible was true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike previous debates in which the candidates focused most of their attacks on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, Wednesday night's attacks were launched at each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney traded jabs over illegal immigration, something they have been arguing about on the trail for the past month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Romney attacked Giuliani's record, saying that as mayor, he promoted illegal immigration. And Giuliani shot back, accusing Romney of having a \"sanctuary mansion\" at his own home.  Watch the debate format produce raw moments »\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In his case, there were six sanctuary cities. He did nothing about them. There was a sanctuary mansion -- at his own home, illegal immigrants were being employed,\" Giuliani said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Romney denied Giuliani's allegation, and the two raised their voices as they tried to talk over each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his quest to appeal to the hard-line immigration wing of the party, Romney also turned some of his fire on the same topic toward former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who has been rising in the polls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rep. Tom Tancredo, who has anchored his candidacy on securing the borders and cracking down on illegal immigration, seemed delighted with the give and take, saying the other candidates were trying to \"out-Tancredo\" him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Huckabee drew one of the night's largest cheers when he said that one of the agencies he would abolish to control federal spending was the Internal Revenue Service.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Most people in this country are more afraid of an audit than they are of a mugging, and there's a reason why,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sen. John McCain, freshly back from a visit to Iraq over Thanksgiving and the most hawkish of the candidates, and Rep. Ron Paul, the most anti-war of the candidates, tangled on two occasions over the Iraq war.  Did  YouTubers get their questions answered? »\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked which government programs they would cut, Paul said bringing the troops home from Iraq would save \"a trillion dollars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "McCain said: \"It's that kind of isolationism that caused World War II,\" which drew some hoots from the crowd.  Watch McCain, Paul spar on Iraq »\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul replied: \"The real question you have to ask is why do I get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A retired brigadier general, Keith Kerr, who is gay, asked candidates if they thought U.S. military personnel were professional enough to work with gay and lesbian troops.\n",
      "\n",
      "CNN later learned that a June media release from the campaign of Democratic  front-runner Clinton listed Kerr as a member of its steering committee for gay and lesbian supporters.  Watch Kerr deny that the Clinton campaign influenced his question »\n",
      "\n",
      "David Bohrman, CNN senior vice president and executive producer of the debate, said, \"We regret this incident. CNN would not have used the general's question had we known that he was connected to any presidential candidate.\" Political Ticker\n",
      "\n",
      "Kerr told CNN after the debate that he has not worked for the Clinton campaign and was representing no one other than himself. Kerr also said he is a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, a national gay and lesbian Republican grass-roots organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to the debate, CNN had verified Kerr's military background and that he had not contributed money to any presidential candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a section of the debate about gun ownership rights, three of the GOP presidential hopefuls said they do not own guns: McCain, Giuliani and Romney.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson quipped, \"I own a couple of guns -- but I'm not going to tell you what they are or where they are.\"  Watch the candidates address gun control »\n",
      "\n",
      "The debate turned personal when a viewer, holding the Bible, asked: \"Do you believe every word of this book? And I mean specifically, this book that I am holding in my hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Huckabee, a Baptist minister, said, \"Sure, I believe the Bible is exactly what it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Giuliani said he believes the Bible, but not \"literally true in every respect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, Romney stammered a bit when moderator Anderson Cooper asked him if he believed every word.  Watch the candidates get personal about the Bible »\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yeah, the Bible is the word of God. ... I might interpret the word differently than you interpret the word, but I read the Bible and I believe the Bible is the word of God,\" Romney said.\n",
      "\n",
      "When asked about abortion, Romney said he was wrong in favoring a woman's right to choose -- his position when he was elected governor of Massachusetts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If people in this country are looking for someone who's never made a mistake on a policy issue and is not willing to admit they're ever wrong, they're going to have to find somebody else. On abortion, I was wrong,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "His remarks came in response to the 30-second video produced for the debate by Thompson's campaign, which included a clip of Romney expressing support for Roe vs. Wade during a 1994 debate against Sen. Ted Kennedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "When asked what women and doctors should be charged with if abortion was to become illegal,  Paul said it was not an issue for the president or the federal government.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't need a federal abortion police, that's the last thing we need,\" Paul said. He added that the issue should be left to the states and courts and not federal authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the issues of taxes, Thompson said he'd \"never met a tax he liked.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got a tax-cut bill on the table. But I don't do pledges to anybody but the American people,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "His response was met by a \"Go, Fred, go!\" from a member of the audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the issue of trade with China, Rep. Duncan Hunter said China is \"cheating on trade ... and it's in the interest of the United States to stop China's cheating. Buy American this Christmas season -- that might keep your neighbor from losing his job.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The candidates fielded video questions submitted by the public via the YouTube Web site, just as Democratic White House candidates did in July.\n",

      "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- None of the 1,000-plus Iraqi detainees freed in recent weeks have broken a pledge not to return to the insurgency, according to the Marine general who oversees the U.S. detention centers in Iraq.\n",
      "\n",
      "A U.S. military panel reviews a detainee's case at Camp Cropper near Baghdad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking in Arabic, Maj. Gen. Doug Stone on Wednesday reassured Iraqis about how the 25,000 detainees -- mostly Sunnis -- are treated after being taken into custody on suspicion of involvement in the insurgency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stone described the detention system as \"open and transparent,\" saying it makes the detainees better citizens and helps break the cycle of violence and poverty in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stone said detainees get free medical care equal to what he gets as a general, food and water made to Islamic standards, educational opportunities, jobs skills and contact with families.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. detention centers -- at Camp Bucca near the southern port city of Basra and in Camp Cropper near Baghdad -- are political sore points for Sunnis, who make up 83 percent of the detainees held. The main Sunni political coalition -- the Iraqi Accord Front -- cited the centers as one reason for quitting the government during the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last month, the U.S.-led coalition launched Operation Lion's Paw in which between 50 and 70 detainees would be released daily during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan after taking a pledge not to rejoin the insurgency against the Shiite-led government.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This pledge is an Iraqi pledge, a pledge before an Iraqi judge, frequently with a family member present,\" Stone said. \"I am pleased to tell you that in the more 1,000 that have gone through this program and taken the pledge, not one has returned to threaten Iraqi or coalition forces.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Stone said the releases would continue at the same pace beyond Ramadan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stone's description seems a far cry from the Abu Ghraib prison operated by the U.S. military in the first years after the invasion. That prison was closed down and razed in the wake of an international scandal over prisoner abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are no secrets that go on in detention,\" Stone said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our facilities are open to inspection by any agency that we in the federal government believe is credible. These agencies are welcomed because they are windows for the world.\"  See what life's like inside Camp Cropper's walls »\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time of their release, \"detainees grow in terms of working in an inter-sectarian environment,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each detainee has a chance to take classes up to a sixth-grade level, and high school classes are being planned, Stone said. About one-third -- or 8,000 -- are in school, with 7,000 having passed the fifth-grade level, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 860 detainees who are 17 or younger are all in school, Stone said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The average stay for a detainee is 300 days, but some have been detained for two years or longer, he said. A review board interviews detainees to decide if they are a threat to security, he said. If they are deemed not to be, they are offered freedom in exchange for taking the pledge.\n",
      "\n",
